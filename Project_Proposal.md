## 1.0 Introduction (Rishabh)
    1.1 Problem Situation
      Nearly 50% of Americans live in areas that don't meet federal air quality
      standards. Passenger vehicles are one of the major sources of air pollution,
      producing significant amounts of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides
      and carbon monoxide. These pollutants contribute towards serious health related
      problems. Our project aims to spread awareness about how much pollutants are
      produced by vehicles in America by every major vehicle manufacturing company.
      Our stakeholders are not just Automotive Industries, but all residents of
      America. We hope to persuade people to buy more eco-friendly and fuel efficient
      vehicles.

    1.2 What is the problem
      Harmful pollutants, like carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, emitted by motor
      vehicles are a major cause of air pollution. Poor air quality poses serious
      health risks and can lead to problems like asthma, bronchitis, and other lung
      diseases. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease,
      lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Nearly 2.5 million
      people die worldwide each year from the effects of air pollution. Along with
      harming human health, air pollution can cause a variety of environmental
      effects such as acid rain, ozone depletion, wildfires, and global climate
      change.

    1.3 Why does it matter
      Reducing pollutants in the air is important for human health and the
      environment. As discussed earlier, motor vehicles release these harmful
      pollutants which lead to circulatory and respiratory issues. It is time that
      we take issues like climate change seriously. Reducing the number of vehicles
      which are not efficient and emit pollutants in large quantities can be a huge
      step towards fighting climate change and providing a healthy life for ourselves
      as well as the future generations.

    1.4 How will it be Addressed?
      Our group aims to expose which vehicle manufacturing companies are good for
      the environment and which ones are harmful, based on the fuel economy and the
      quantity of pollutants emitted by the cars manufactured by these companies.
      We are using large and reliable datasets for our project which will enable
      us to analyze and provide this information. This will help in spreading
      awareness and influencing people's decision while buying new cars. This in
      turn can also bring down the sales of car companies which do not make
      environmental friendly cars, forcing them to refine their manufacturing methods.

## 2.0 Research Questions (Brian)

    - Research Question 1:
    Which car manufacturer makes the greenest, most environmentally friendly
    cars on the market? Which cars are the greenest, most environmentally
    friendly cars on the market?

    - Research Question 2:
    Does the environmental friendliness of different cars vary much, or do they
    all basically pollute the same base amount? How much is this variance and
    what factors does it stem from the most?

## 3.0 Possible Data Sets (Xiying)
    Describe two possible data sets that you might work with. Include name, short
    description [30-60 words], link, and number of observations and number of
    attributes.

    - Data Set Number 1 <Text>
    - Data Set Number 2 <Text>

## 4.0 Information Visualizations (Brian)
![Electric Car Ratings](https://www.plugincars.com/sites/default/files/2017-ev-safety-ratings-620.jpg)  

    This graphic shows the ranking of different models of cars  based on safety
    and comfort ratings, giving them different scores based on how the creators of
    this visualization determined their ranking. In our project, we plan to make
    a similar visualization except instead of ranking safety and comfort features
    it will rank environmental friendliness and fuel efficiency, as well as other
    variables associated with green cars.

![Electric Car Sales by Country](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/05/US-EV-Sales-4-2019.png)  

    This graphic shows the number of electric cars sold, sorted by model of car.
    In our visualization we plan on ranking cars based on how many pollutants they
    release into the air and / or how fuel efficient these vehicles are compared
    to each other.

## 5.0 Team Coordination (all of us)
    You should document at least the following:
    (a) Weekly time: Thursday 3.30-4.30 PM
    (b) Your individual goal(s) for the project and your roles;
      - Brian: My goal for this project is create something that
      I can be proud of looking back on, and to increase my
      understanding of data science and informatics.
      -
      -

    (c) A commitment on how you will communicate weekly; and
    (d) An commitment on how you will give each other feedback on working
    together and how you will address communication challenges or work breakdowns.
