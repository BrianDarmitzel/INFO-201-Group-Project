## 1.0 Introduction (Rishabh)
    1.1 Problem Situation
      Describe the general problem situation – Who are the stakeholders? What is the
      setting of the problem? What values and tensions are in play? What policy and ethic
      elements may exist? [60-100 words]

    1.2 What is the problem
      What is the problem? [60–100 words].

      Why does the problem matter? [60–100 words]

    1.4 How will it be Addressed?
      How will you address the problem [60–100 words]

## 2.0 Research Questions (Brian)

    - Research Question 1:
    Which car manufacturer makes the greenest, most environmentally friendly
    cars on the market? Which cars are the greenest, most environmentally
    friendly cars on the market?

    - Research Question 2:
    Does the environmental friendliness of different cars vary much, or do they
    all basically pollute the same base amount? How much is this variance and
    what factors does it stem from the most?

## 3.0 Possible Data Sets (Xiying)
    Describe two possible data sets that you might work with. Include name, short
    description [30-60 words], link, and number of observations and number of
    attributes.

    - Data Set Number 1 <Text>
    - Data Set Number 2 <Text>

## 4.0 Information Visualizations (Brian)
![Electric Car Ratings](https://www.plugincars.com/sites/default/files/2017-ev-safety-ratings-620.jpg)  

    This graphic shows the ranking of different models of cars  based on safety
    and comfort ratings, giving them different scores based on how the creators of
    this visualization determined their ranking. In our project, we plan to make
    a similar visualization except instead of ranking safety and comfort features
    it will rank environmental friendliness and fuel efficiency, as well as other
    variables associated with green cars.

![Electric Car Sales by Country](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/05/US-EV-Sales-4-2019.png)  

    This graphic shows the number of electric cars sold, sorted by model of car.
    In our visualization we plan on ranking cars based on how many pollutants they
    release into the air and / or how fuel efficient these vehicles are compared
    to each other.
