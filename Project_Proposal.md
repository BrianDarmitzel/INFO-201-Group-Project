## 1.0 Introduction
#### 1.1 Problem Situation
Nearly 50% of Americans live in areas that don't meet federal air quality standards. Passenger vehicles are one of the major sources of air pollution, producing significant amounts of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. These pollutants contribute towards serious health related problems. Our project aims to spread awareness about how much pollutants are produced by vehicles in America by every major vehicle manufacturing company. Our stakeholders are not just Automotive Industries, but all residents of America. We hope to persuade people to buy more eco-friendly and fuel efficient vehicles.

#### 1.2 What is the problem
Harmful pollutants, like carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, emitted by motor vehicles are a major cause of air pollution. Poor air quality poses serious health risks and can lead to problems like asthma, bronchitis, and other lung diseases. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Nearly 2.5 million people die worldwide each year from the effects of air pollution. Along with harming human health, air pollution can cause a variety of environmental effects such as acid rain, ozone depletion, wildfires, and global climate change.

#### 1.3 Why does it matter
Reducing pollutants in the air is important for human health and the environment. As discussed earlier, motor vehicles release these harmful pollutants which lead to circulatory and respiratory issues. It is time that we take issues like climate change seriously. Reducing the number of vehicles which are not efficient and emit pollutants in large quantities can be a huge step towards fighting climate change and providing a healthy life for ourselves as well as the future generations.

#### 1.4 How will it be Addressed?
Our group aims to expose which vehicle manufacturing companies are good for the environment and which ones are harmful, based on the fuel economy and the quantity of pollutants emitted by the cars manufactured by these companies. We are using large and reliable datasets for our project which will enable us to analyze and provide this information. This will help in spreading awareness and influencing people's decision while buying new cars. This in turn can also bring down the sales of car companies which do not make environmental friendly cars, forcing them to refine their manufacturing methods.


## 2.0 Research Questions
#### Research Question 1:
Which car manufacturer makes the greenest, most environmentally friendly cars on the market? Which cars are the greenest, most environmentally friendly cars on the market?
    
#### Research Question 2:
Does the environmental friendliness of different cars vary much, or do they all basically pollute the same base amount? How much is this variance and what factors does it stem from the most?


## 3.0 Possible Data Sets
1. [Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks Test Results](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-02/light-duty-vehicle-test-results-report-2014-present.xlsx)  
    This dataset collects the basic information about cars, such as the manufacturer name, vehicle category, and the fuel type. Most importantly, it shows the CO2 standard(g/ton-mile),which informs us of how much CO2 would be emitted per mile, and thus how serious it would affect our environment. As shown in the dataset, the vehicles consuming diesel and natural gas commonly have lower CO2 standard, compared to those using gasoline and electricity. Therefore, by analyzing such dataset might help us to find out which type of vehicle is most environmentally friendly.

2. [Vehicles Fuel Economy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip)  
    This dataset provides the vehicle information with much more details. It covers the car category: vans or compact cars, automatic or manual, rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Since we aim to determine which type of vehicle result in less pollutions, the vehicle category with more variables would lead to more accurate analysis. In addition, the dataset includes green house gas scores(ghgScore), not only CO2 standard, which helps us comprehensively figure out its impact on environment.

## 4.0 Information Visualizations

![Electric Car Ratings](https://www.plugincars.com/sites/default/files/2017-ev-safety-ratings-620.jpg)  
    This graphic shows the ranking of different models of cars  based on safety and comfort ratings, giving them different scores based on how the creators of this visualization determined their ranking. In our project, we plan to make a similar visualization except instead of ranking safety and comfort features it will rank environmental friendliness and fuel efficiency, as well as other variables associated with green cars.

![Electric Car Sales by Country](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/05/US-EV-Sales-4-2019.png)  
    This graphic shows the number of electric cars sold, sorted by model of car. In our visualization we plan on ranking cars based on how many pollutants they release into the air and/or how fuel efficient these vehicles are compared to each other.


## 5.0 Team Coordination
    (a) Weekly meeting time: Thur 3.30-5.30 PM
    (b) Your individual goal(s) for the project and your roles;
      - Brian: My goal for this project is create something that
      I can be proud of looking back on, and to increase my
      understanding of data science and informatics.
      - Rishabh: I hope to build something creative that can have
      an impact on society, using my technical skills. I'm looking
      forward to learning data science tools as well.
      - Xiying: I wish I could conclude something meaningful at the end by
      analyzing the data so that make a contribution in my community.
      For this project, I hope the data could convince more people to
      choose the "green car" and pay attention to our environmental issues.
      In this process, I'll cooperate with my teammates and improve
      my coding ability as possible as I can.

    (c) We will communicate with each other through message.
    (d) We have created a github repository where everyone can make a change.
    For any project problems, we will discuss in group chat or weekly meeting.
