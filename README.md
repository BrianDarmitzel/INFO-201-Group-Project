### WHICH CARS ARE GONNA SAVE THE WORLD?

Our project aims to spread awareness regarding the rising air pollution due to harmful pollutants emitted by motor vehicles. Reducing pollutants in the air is important for human health and the environment. By showing which cars are the most eco-friendly and fuel efficient, we hope to influence people's decision into buying cars which do the least harm to the environment.
